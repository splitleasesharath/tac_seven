# Patch: Execute E2E Visual Comparison Test with Playwright Production Access

## Metadata
adw_id: `3798fcbc`
review_change_request: `Issue #3: The validation commands in the spec require running the E2E test '.claude/commands/e2e/test_search_filter_alignment.md' which includes steps 7-10 for navigating to production, capturing production screenshots, and verifying visual element matching. This test cannot be fully executed without Playwright access to the production page. The test file itself acknowledges this limitation with the note 'Due to Playwright MCP limitations, manual visual comparison may be required.' Resolution: Execute the E2E test with working Playwright to capture screenshots of both local (http://localhost:9212/search/) and production (https://app.split.lease/search) pages. Store comparison screenshots in the review_img directory and visually validate that key elements match. Severity: blocker`

## Issue Summary
**Original Spec:** `specs/issue-1-adw-3798fcbc-sdlc_planner-search-filter-section-fixes.md`
**Issue:** The E2E test file `.claude/commands/e2e/test_search_filter_alignment.md` was created to validate filter section visual alignment with production, but steps 7-10 (production page navigation, production screenshot capture, and visual element matching verification) cannot be executed due to Playwright MCP limitations preventing access to the production page at https://app.split.lease/search. This prevents complete validation that the local implementation matches the production design.
**Solution:** Execute the complete E2E test using Playwright MCP server to navigate to both local (http://localhost:9212/search/) and production (https://app.split.lease/search) pages, capture full-page and focused filter section screenshots of both environments, store all comparison screenshots in a structured review_img directory, and perform visual validation to confirm key design elements match between local and production implementations.

## Files to Modify
Use these files to implement the patch:

- `.claude/commands/e2e/test_search_filter_alignment.md` - Update test to ensure production steps are executable and remove limitation note
- No code files need modification - this is a test execution and validation patch

## Implementation Steps
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### Step 1: Prepare Application and Environment
- Read and execute `.claude/commands/prepare_app.md` to ensure the local development server is running
- Verify local search page is accessible at http://localhost:9212/search/
- Create review_img directory structure: `C:\Users\Split Lease\splitleaseteam\!Agent Context and Tools\SL1\Practice TAC\New\Full TAC\trees\3798fcbc\review_img\search_filter_comparison\`
- Initialize Playwright browser in headed mode using the playwright MCP server

### Step 2: Execute E2E Test Steps 1-6 (Local Page Validation)
- Read `.claude/commands/e2e/test_search_filter_alignment.md` completely
- Execute test steps 1-6 following the test file instructions:
  - Step 1: Navigate to local search page at http://localhost:9212/search/
  - Step 2: Take screenshot of initial page state → save as `review_img/search_filter_comparison/01_local_initial_page.png`
  - Step 3: Verify filter section is visible and properly rendered using `browser_snapshot`
  - Step 4: Verify all core filter UI elements are present (listed in test step 4)
  - Step 5: Take focused screenshot of filter section → save as `review_img/search_filter_comparison/02_local_filter_section.png`
  - Step 6: Verify filter section styling matches production design system (colors, typography, borders per test step 6)
- Document any failures or discrepancies found in steps 1-6

### Step 3: Execute E2E Test Steps 7-10 (Production Page Validation)
- Execute production-specific test steps using Playwright:
  - Step 7: Navigate to production page at https://app.split.lease/search using `browser_navigate`
  - Step 8: Take screenshot of production page → save as `review_img/search_filter_comparison/03_production_initial_page.png`
  - Step 9: Take focused screenshot of production filter section → save as `review_img/search_filter_comparison/04_production_filter_section.png`
  - Step 10: Verify key visual elements match production design system (purple color scheme, typography, borders, spacing per test step 10)
- Use `browser_snapshot` to capture accessibility tree of production filter section for structural comparison
- Use `browser_evaluate` with `window.getComputedStyle()` to extract actual computed CSS values from production filter elements

### Step 4: Execute E2E Test Steps 11-14 (Interaction Testing)
- Return to local page navigation (http://localhost:9212/search/)
- Execute interaction test steps:
  - Step 11: Test filter interactions (bedroom button click, amenity checkbox, location input)
  - Step 12: Click "Apply Filters" button
  - Step 13: Verify button click is registered
  - Step 14: Take final screenshot with active states → save as `review_img/search_filter_comparison/05_local_filter_active_states.png`
- Document interaction test results

### Step 5: Visual Comparison and Analysis
- Perform side-by-side visual comparison of captured screenshots:
  - Compare `01_local_initial_page.png` with `03_production_initial_page.png`
  - Compare `02_local_filter_section.png` with `04_production_filter_section.png`
- Identify and document specific visual discrepancies:
  - Color value differences (hex codes)
  - Typography differences (font-family, font-size, font-weight)
  - Spacing differences (padding, margins, gaps)
  - Border style differences (width, color, border-radius)
  - Layout alignment differences
  - Shadow or visual effect differences
- Create annotated comparison document highlighting matched and mismatched elements

### Step 6: Validate Success Criteria
- Review all success criteria from test file (lines 69-82):
  - ✓ Filter section is visible and properly positioned on the left side
  - ✓ All filter groups are present and properly structured
  - ✓ Filter inputs and controls are functional
  - ✓ Visual styling matches modern web standards
  - ✓ Interactive elements respond to user input
  - ✓ Layout is responsive and well-organized
  - ✓ Minimum 5 screenshots are captured (verify all 5 exist in review_img directory)
- Mark test as passed if all success criteria are met, or failed with specific explanation if any criterion fails

### Step 7: Update Test File to Remove Limitation Note
- Edit `.claude/commands/e2e/test_search_filter_alignment.md` line 98
- Remove the limitation note: "Due to Playwright MCP limitations, manual visual comparison may be required"
- Replace with: "This test uses Playwright MCP server to automatically capture and compare screenshots from both local and production environments"
- Update test documentation to reflect that production access is now working

### Step 8: Generate Test Report
- Create comprehensive test execution report with:
  - Test status (passed/failed)
  - All 5 screenshot paths in review_img directory
  - List of verified elements that match production
  - List of any visual discrepancies found with specific details
  - Extracted production CSS values for reference
  - Recommendations for any remaining alignment work needed
- Return report in JSON format per `.claude/commands/test_e2e.md` output structure

## Validation
Execute every command to validate the patch is complete with zero regressions.

- Verify all 5 required screenshots exist in `review_img/search_filter_comparison/` directory with descriptive names
- Verify screenshots are viewable PNG files with actual page content (not blank or error pages)
- Verify local screenshots show filter section with all UI elements listed in test step 4
- Verify production screenshots successfully captured https://app.split.lease/search page content
- Verify test report documents comparison results with specific visual element analysis
- Read `.claude/commands/test.md` and execute all backend/frontend validation tests to ensure zero regressions
- Manual validation: Open all 5 screenshots and visually confirm they show the expected page states

## Patch Scope
**Lines of code to change:** 1 (update limitation note in test file)
**Risk level:** low (test execution only, no production code changes)
**Testing required:** E2E test execution with Playwright production page access, screenshot capture validation, visual comparison analysis, success criteria verification
