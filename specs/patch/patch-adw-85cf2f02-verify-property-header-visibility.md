# Patch: Verify PropertyHeader Component Visibility After Bundle Rebuild

## Metadata
adw_id: `85cf2f02`
review_change_request: `Issue #2: PropertyHeader component is not visible on the page despite correct implementation. Only the 'Listing Images' placeholder is showing. This is a direct consequence of issue #1 - the component cannot mount due to the bundle error. Resolution: This will be resolved automatically once issue #1 is fixed and the bundle is rebuilt. Severity: blocker`

## Issue Summary
**Original Spec:** specs/issue-11-adw-85cf2f02-sdlc_planner-property-title-basic-info.md
**Issue:** PropertyHeader component is not visible on the view-split-lease page because the UMD bundle had `process.env.NODE_ENV` references causing mounting failures. Issue #1 has been patched (vite.config.ts now has the `define` configuration) and the bundle has been rebuilt.
**Solution:** Verify that the PropertyHeader component now mounts correctly and is visible on the page by running the full test suite. No code changes are required - this is a verification patch.

## Files to Modify
No files need to be modified. This patch verifies that issue #1's resolution has fixed issue #2.

## Implementation Steps
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### Step 1: Verify bundle no longer contains process.env references
- Check that the rebuilt UMD bundle at `app/split-lease/components/dist/split-lease-components.umd.cjs` does not contain `process.env.NODE_ENV` references
- The bundle was rebuilt at 09:38 after the vite.config.ts fix was applied

### Step 2: Run component validation tests
- Execute the full test suite to verify PropertyHeader mounts correctly
- Validate that console errors about "missing dependencies" are resolved
- Confirm PropertyHeader island renders on view-split-lease page

## Validation
Execute every command to validate the patch is complete with zero regressions.

1. **Verify bundle does not contain process.env references**
   - Command: `grep -n "process\.env" app/split-lease/components/dist/split-lease-components.umd.cjs`
   - Expected: No matches found (exit code 1 is success for grep with no matches)

2. **TypeScript Type Check**
   - Command: `cd app/split-lease/components && npm run typecheck`
   - Expected: Pass with no type errors

3. **Component Build**
   - Command: `cd app/split-lease/components && npm run build`
   - Expected: Build succeeds and generates UMD bundle

4. **UMD Bundle Validation**
   - Command: `cd app/test-harness && npm run test:validate`
   - Expected: Bundle validation passes, PropertyHeader is exported correctly

5. **Component Contract Tests**
   - Command: `cd app/test-harness && npx playwright test --grep "contract"`
   - Expected: All component contract tests pass, PropertyHeader island mounts successfully

6. **Component Diagnostic Tests**
   - Command: `cd app/test-harness && npx playwright test --grep "diagnostics"`
   - Expected: PropertyHeader displays correctly, no console errors about 'process is not defined' or 'missing dependencies'

## Patch Scope
**Lines of code to change:** 0 (verification only)
**Risk level:** low
**Testing required:** Full test suite to confirm PropertyHeader component is now visible and functional after issue #1 was resolved
