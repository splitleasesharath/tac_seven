**ADW ID:** 6445fc8f
**Date:** 2025-07-29
**Specification:** specs/issue-15-adw-6445fc8f-sdlc_planner-light-sky-blue-background.md

## Overview

Updated the application's background color from off-white (#fafafa) to a light sky blue (#E0F6FF) to provide a more visually appealing appearance while maintaining good readability and visual hierarchy across the application.

## What Was Built

- Updated CSS background color variable to light sky blue
- Maintained compatibility with existing UI components and color scheme

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

- `app/client/src/style.css`: Changed the `--background` CSS variable from `#fafafa` to `#E0F6FF`

### Key Changes

- Modified the root CSS variable `--background` from off-white to light sky blue
- Selected `#E0F6FF` as the light sky blue color for optimal readability and visual appeal
- Preserved all other color variables to maintain existing visual hierarchy

## How to Use

The background color change is automatically applied across the entire application:

1. The new light sky blue background appears on all pages
2. All existing UI components maintain their visual hierarchy with the new background
3. No user action is required - the change is immediately visible

## Configuration

The background color is controlled by the CSS variable `--background` in `app/client/src/style.css`. To modify the background color:

1. Update the `--background` variable value
2. Rebuild the client application with `cd app/client && bun run build`

## Testing

To verify the background color change:

1. Run `cd app/server && uv run pytest` to ensure no regressions
2. Build the frontend with `cd app/client && bun run build`
3. Start the application with `cd app && ../scripts/start.sh`
4. Visually confirm the light sky blue background is applied

## Notes

- The light sky blue color (#E0F6FF) provides a calming, professional appearance
- The color maintains excellent readability with existing text and UI elements
- All sections (query, results, tables, modals) preserve proper visual hierarchy
- The change is subtle enough to not interfere with existing components while providing the desired visual update
