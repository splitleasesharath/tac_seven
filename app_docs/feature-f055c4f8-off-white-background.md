# Off-White Background Update

**ADW ID:** f055c4f8
**Date:** 2025-07-29
**Specification:** specs/issue-12-adw-f055c4f8-sdlc_planner-off-white-background.md

## Overview

Updated the application's background color from a light gray-blue tone to a neutral off-white color. This change provides a more neutral appearance while maintaining good readability and visual hierarchy across the application.

## What Was Built

- Modified the CSS color variable for the primary background color
- Changed from `#f5f7fa` (light gray-blue) to `#fafafa` (off-white)
- Ensured consistency across all application sections

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

- `app/client/src/style.css`: Updated the `--background` CSS variable from `#f5f7fa` to `#fafafa`

### Key Changes

- Changed the `--background` CSS variable on line 9 of `style.css`
- The new off-white color provides a more neutral appearance
- All UI elements continue to work with the light background palette
- No other color adjustments were needed as existing colors are designed for light backgrounds

## How to Use

The background color change is automatically applied across the entire application:

1. The body background uses the `--background` CSS variable
2. All sections (query section, results section, tables section, modals) inherit this neutral background
3. Text and UI elements maintain proper contrast with the new background

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The change is applied through the CSS variable system:

```css
--background: #fafafa; /* Off-white background */
```

## Testing

To verify the changes:

1. Start the development server
2. Verify the background appears off-white instead of light gray-blue
3. Check that all text and UI elements have good contrast
4. Ensure all sections remain visually coherent

## Notes

- The change is subtle but provides a more neutral appearance
- Maintains the existing light theme design
- All other CSS colors continue to work with the new background
- The off-white color `#fafafa` was chosen for optimal readability and visual hierarchy
