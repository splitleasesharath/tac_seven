**ADW ID:** cc73faf1
**Date:** 2025-07-31
**Specification:** /Users/indydevdanagents/Documents/projects/agentic-engineer/tactical-agentic-coding/tac-7/trees/cc73faf1/specs/issue-47-adw-cc73faf1-sdlc_planner-update-upload-button.md

## Overview

Updated the "Upload Data" button text to "Upload" for a more concise UI while maintaining all existing functionality. This simple text change affects both the client interface and documentation.

## What Was Built

- Updated button text in client HTML from "Upload Data" to "Upload"
- Updated documentation to reflect the button text change
- Maintained all existing button functionality and styling

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

- `app/client/index.html`: Changed button text from "Upload Data" to "Upload" on line 25
- `README.md`: Updated usage documentation to reference "Upload" button instead of "Upload Data" on line 78

### Key Changes

- Button text shortened from "Upload Data" to "Upload" for more concise UI
- Documentation updated to maintain consistency with actual UI
- Button ID (`upload-data-button`) and CSS classes (`secondary-button`) preserved to maintain functionality
- Modal header remains "Upload Data" to provide context for what the modal does

## How to Use

1. Click the "Upload" button to open the data upload modal
2. Use sample data buttons for quick testing or drag and drop your own .csv or .json files
3. Uploading a file with the same name will overwrite the existing table

## Configuration

No configuration changes required. The button maintains all existing functionality with just the text updated.

## Testing

- Server tests: `cd app/server && uv run pytest`
- Client build: `cd app/client && bun run build`

## Notes

This is a purely cosmetic change that does not affect any functionality. The modal header "Upload Data" was intentionally kept unchanged to provide context for what the modal does, while only the button text was made more concise.
